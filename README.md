### Personal Website - Vanilla Version

Why did I make two versions of the same site? I don't know ~ to see how they compare I guess! 

Used some fake client-side routing (jQuery'd the navbar) to give that ~ SPA ~ effect, but of course the hashed URLS aren't real URLS 

Pages and images load faster in this one because, so simple ~
