### Personal Website - Vanilla Version

Why did I make two versions of the same site? I don't know ~ to see how they compare I guess! 

Used some fake client-side routing (jQuery'd the navbar) to give that ~ SPA ~ effect, but of course the hashed URLS aren't real URLS 

I like that one better, but I'm keeping this one to play around with some things for the future.

also, I'm coming back to change the image loading, it needs placeholders
