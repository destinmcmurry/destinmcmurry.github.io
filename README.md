### Personal Website - Vanilla Version

Why did I make two versions of the same site? I don't know ~ to see how they compare I guess! 

It's so simple! It's so slow!

Used some fake client-side routing (jQuery'd the navbar) to give that ~ SPA ~ effect, but wow it's incredibly slow and of course not linkable from my fake URLs - I'll keep researching better ways to do this, or would love suggestions if you're reading ;)
