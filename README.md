### Personal Website - Vanilla Version

Why did I make two versions of the same site? I don't know ~ to see how they compare I guess! 

Get it started with:

    node server.js

Used some fake client-side routing (jQuery'd the navbar) to give that ~ SPA ~ effect, seems much slower tbh and will keep researching better ways to do this
