### Personal Website - React Version

all about me, my road to code, and my projects

check out the vanilla version for a re-code I did to compare the two, it's so simple, only ~ 3 ~ files!

I like that one better, but I'm keeping this one to play around with some things for the future.

also, I'm coming back to change the image loading, it needs placeholders
